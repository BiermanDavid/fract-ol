# 🎨 fract-ol — Summary
A computer‑graphics project focused on rendering and exploring fractals using the MiniLibX graphical library.  
**Final Grade:** ⭐ *120/100* (bonus completed)

---

## **Project Objectives**
The goal of this project was to create an interactive fractal viewer using MiniLibX. The program needed to render fractals like the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, handle zooming and movement, and respond smoothly to user input. This project introduced me to graphical programming, event handling, and the use of complex numbers in rendering. It also helped me understand how to manage performance while drawing thousands of pixels every frame.

## **Learning Outcome**
Working on fract-ol taught me how to use MiniLibX to create windows, draw images, and handle keyboard and mouse events. I learned how fractals are generated mathematically and how complex numbers influence their shapes. I also learned how to optimize rendering so zooming and movement feel responsive. Completing the bonus helped me explore additional fractal datasets, implement mouse‑position zooming, and add color‑shifting effects. Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of graphics programming and interactive rendering.
